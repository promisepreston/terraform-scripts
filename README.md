# BONUS: How To Get Terraform Certified In Less Than 3 Hours
Hi fellow engineer,



Want to know how you can get Terraform Certified in less than 3 hours?



## From Zero to Certified Terraform Hero


Whether you’re a beginner or expert, this hands-on course will teach you everything you need to pass the exam in less than 3 hours. If you want, you could watch the course in the morning and get certified by the afternoon.


I’ve gone through all the criteria, summarized it, and condensed all the information you need. And I put it into simple step-by-step videos.


It also includes a crash course for those with no experience with Terraform or not familiar with the new 0.12 syntax that’s used.


## Only the Exact Knowledge You Need to Pass the Exam


Don’t waste time on unnecessary topics you don’t need to know about.

For example, you don’t need to learn how to set up a DB server when the certification asks you about state file management practices and variable loading orders.


What you need to know are the key concepts, best practices, and the ways HashiCorp wants you to “use” Terraform versus how you would do it in industry.


Specifically, you need to know the best practices for state management, secret management, module management, versioning, the Terraform workflow for individuals, teams, and Terraform Cloud, as well as the new changes in Terraform 0.12.


And this course will teach you all of it.

Also, this certification course is cloud agnostic. It doesn’t matter whether you’ve worked with AWS, Azure, GCP or even Alibaba Cloud before as it doesn’t lean towards a particular platform.


## What You’ll Get Inside The Course:

* Demos of what is in the certification

* Handy links to useful resources

* Condensed information to prepare you for the exam

* 115 videos and 3 hours of material

* All the code used in demos hosted for you on GitHub



## By The End of This Course You’ll…

* Be some of the first engineers to get the certification

* Know Terraform and industry best-practices

* Stand out from the crowd with your new certification

* Know so much more about Terraform than when you started


## Be One Of The First Who’s Terraform Certified.

Students over on the Warp 9 platform have already passed using this course and so can you!
